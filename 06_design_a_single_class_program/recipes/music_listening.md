Music Listening Class Design Recipe
1. Describe the Problem
Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

2. Design the Class Interface
Include the initializer and public methods with all parameters and return values.

# EXAMPLE

class Reminder
  def initialize(name) # name is a string
    # ...
  end

  def remind_me_to(task) # task is a string
    # No return value
  end

  def remind()
    # Throws an exception if no task is set
    # Otherwise, returns a string reminding the user to do the task
  end
end
3. Create Examples as Tests
Make a list of examples of how the class will behave in different situations.

# EXAMPLE

# 1
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind_me_to("Walk the dog")
reminder.remind() # => "Walk the dog, Kay!"

# 2
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind() # fails with "No task set."

# 3
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind_me_to("")
reminder.remind() # => ", Kay!"
Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go.

4. Implement the Behaviour
After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
